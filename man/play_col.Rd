\arguments{
\item{e}{The current endowment}

\item{max_n}{The remaining number of trials for all players (e.g., if 5 players play 5 trials each this number would be 25)}

\item{n_players}{The number of players}

\item{r1}{The probability of extinction when choosing the risky lottery (outcome 1)}

\item{r2}{The probability of outcome 2 when choosing the risky lottery}

\item{r3}{The probability of outcome 3 when choosing the risky lottery}

\item{s1}{the probability of outcome 1 when choosing the safe lottery}

\item{s2}{the probability of outcome 2 when choosing the safe lottery}

\item{payoff_r2}{The payoff of outcome 2 when choosing the risky lottery}

\item{payoff_r3}{The payoff of outcome 3 when choosing the risky lottery}

\item{payoff_s1}{The payoff of outcome 1 when choosing the safe lottery}

\item{payoff_s2}{The payoff of outcome 2 when choosing the safe lottery}

\item{coord}{Whether players can coordinate (e.g., through text) to hit a specific target number of risky choices or not}
}
\value{
A list with the expected payoff when following the optimal strategy and the optimal next choice.
}
\description{
This function simulates n agents that plays the extinction gambling task following the optimal dynamic strategy.
